# Linux - Where to Start?

The initial step that I had to take was to decide which Linux distribution to use. After doing some research, I decided to go with Ubuntu 18.04 with the Long-Term Support (LTS). 

## Why I Chose Ubuntu:

There were several reasons for this choice. One of the two biggest reason was that the documentation provided for this distro was pretty good in my opinion. The other reason was that there was a lot of support provided by the community of poeple that use Ubuntu (and this paid off because I ran into some initial installation issues which were solved due to people having solved those issues on online forums). 

## Should You Choose Ubuntu?

It is not necessary that you use Ubuntu. I used it because I was told as a new user of Linux I would not have many issues with it. If you believe you are comfortable at using some other Linux distro, you should use that one instead. 

### How to Get Ubuntu:

Here is the [Ubuntu website](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) that I used to get the `.iso` file for Ubuntu. You need to create a bootable USB that runs this `.iso` file. It is recommended that you use a USB with at least 4GB storage, but I kept it safe and used one with 8GB storage. There are many guides as to how one can install and run Ubuntu (and I leave this as a challenge to the Computer Science people to figure out your best resource and implement it). 

### How I Implemented Ubuntu:

What I did was that I partitioned my Hard Disk Drive (HDD) so that I can have a dual boot system which would run both Windows and Linux (not simultaneoulsy - you can run one at a time, but I can choose which one when my computer turns on). Now most peolpe would have a Solid State Drive (SSD), on which you can perform the same tasks. If you want to do the same thing, I'll advise you right now to backup everything you have especially if all of your files are on the same drive as the one you're about to install Linux. I wish you good luck with your future endeavors (and if you think that I will be off any help, do feel free to contact me).
